# Git Cheat Sheet

Git is a [distributed version control system](https://github.com/git/git), the most popular of it's type. Git integration is often built 
into software IDEs or their own systems, such as `gitgui` or `gitkraken`, but the most powerful and robust way to use git is via a terminal.

I am of the opinion that git is **the most important tool a software developer can learn**, over any other technology, tool, or language, 
although the reason for this may not be as clear at first. Git can let you revert and save changes, ensure that you never break a working version, and 
allow for asynchronous collaboration without conficts between changes multiple people have made to the same codebase.

Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds - the same guy that originally created linux, and [notoriously doesn't like Nvidia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYWzMvlj2RQ) 
According to it's own readme, the name can mean many things:

> The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very
first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker"
and the name as (depending on your mood):

>  - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
   mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
>  - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the
   dictionary of slang.
>  - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually
   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
>  - "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh\*t": when it breaks
